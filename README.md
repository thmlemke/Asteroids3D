# Asteroids 3D
### A 3D web browser rendition of the classic game Asteroids
Initially hacked together in 2016 as a final assignment in a 3D graphics course in my third semester of university.

This was my first application of HTML/javascript to a more-than-trivial task, as such it contains some terrible code.

Uncovered in nov 2018 in an archive file among my university files, it seems like a project worth continuing at some point.

TODO: Refactor EVERYTHING!
